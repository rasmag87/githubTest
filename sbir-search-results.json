        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIn the intensive care unit (ICU), enteral nutrition (EN) is a critical component of care that provides both nutritional\nand non-nutritional benefits including decreased risk of infection, shorter hospital stay and decreased risk of\nmortality. It is estimated that more than 1.2 million feeding tubes (FTs) are used each year in the United States\nto deliver EN. Hospital and critical care admittance increase with age resulting in patients older than 65 years\nbeing the largest subpopulation within the ICU to benefit from rapid and consistent EN. The current gold standard\nmethod for FT placement, blind bedside insertion, results in first attempt placement failure in 8-60% (Average\n32.3%) of cases. If undetected, these misplacements can lead to serious patient harm. As such, radiographic\nverification is required to confirm the correct FT positioning. With the high rate of failed attempts, the inherent\ndelays associated with repeated x-rays not only add to personnel time and health care costs but can lead to\nsuboptimal outcomes for patients where early EN is critical. Once placed, unintentional FT dislodgement occurs\nin as many as 33-63% of FTs and has the potential to be a serious hazard if EN is delivered into the pharynx or\nlungs. Thus, FT position must be routinely verified by critical care staff and, if necessary, re-inserted with\nplacement confirmation, all of which results in increased demand on nursing time, increased cost and delayed\nEN. To reduce the occurrence of misplacement, smart FT systems have recently been developed, but the high\ncosts and expertise\/training required to use these devices have limited their clinical adoption. Further, these\nsmart systems do not monitor for FT dislodgement. Thus, there is still an urgent need for a smart FT that is an\neasy-to-use, inexpensive, and comprehensive solution for patient EN care. TheraNova has developed this\nsolution in the Entarik System, a low-cost enteral feeding system that provides real-time confirmation of FT\nlocation at the bedside for both insertion guidance and dislodgement management. In our previous work, the\nEntarik System (1) accurately classified the airway, esophagus and stomach in a clinical study (2) accurately\ndetected dislodgement of the FT into the esophagus from the stomach and (3) demonstrated reliable, durable\nperformance in a bench simulation of the gastric environment. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the safe\nand effective FT placement and dislodgement detection in both healthy and critically ill patients. In Specific Aim\n1, a clinical study in healthy participants prior to and following gastric acid suppression will validate the accuracy\nof Entarik in both guided FT placement and dislodgement detection. In Specific Aim 2, a randomized, controlled\nstudy will be conducted to validate the performance of the Entarik System in aging medical and surgical ICU\npatients, as this represents a large population of high-risk patients for FT misplacement. The successful\ncompletion of the proposed effort will support 510(k) clearance of the Entarik System for guiding FT placement\nwithout the need for x-ray confirmation. As a low-cost and easy-to-use system, the performance data will support\nthat our device is an overall superior option to current smart FTs, driving clinical adoption."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic, recurring condition that affects approximately 6.4 million\nAmerican adults each year. GAD is one of the most common anxiety disorders and is costly to treat, with medical\ncosts that are 33% higher than other anxiety disorders. Recent weekly GAD-2 surveys by the U.S. Census\nBureau have indicated that the prevalence of GAD may be sharply increasing as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. As of July 2020, 36% of American adults have symptoms of GAD vs. 8% before the pandemic. Taken\ntogether, there is a need for a comprehensive therapy to effectively treat GAD. First-line treatments for GAD\ninclude medication (e.g. SSRIs, SNRIs), cognitive behavioral therapy, or both in combination. Unfortunately,\nthese all have shown modest long-term remission rates of only 20-50%. Medications also have common,\nundesirable side effects that limit acceptability to patients. Benzodiazepines (BZs) are the most effective\nmedication for treating GAD. However, guidelines recommend only prescribing BZs for short-term use due to\nthe potential to develop tolerance and dependence. Neuromodulation investigations via repetitive transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation (rTMS) have recently shown great promise for treating GAD, with responder rates of 64-\n100% in short-term studies. However, rTMS is expensive ($6,000-$12,000 for a 20-30 treatment course) and\nrequires daily visits to the clinic, limiting the potential for widespread adoption. Recent preclinical and clinical\nstudies have also shown that acupuncture-based nerve stimulation can be effective for treating anxiety, but it\nhas the key limitation that treatment must be administered by an acupuncturist in the clinic or at home. To build\non this work and address the need for a comprehensive therapy for GAD, TheraNova has developed the\nEmpower Neuromodulation System, a portable, non-invasive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation\n(TENS), or transcutaneous electroacupuncture, device for non-invasive stimulation of peripheral nerves. The\nEmpower Neuromodulation System consists of standard, inexpensive TENS gel electrodes and a small, battery-\npowered signal generator. The goal of this proposal is to conduct a pilot clinical study to evaluate the potential\nof Empower as a treatment for GAD. We will conduct a 6-week, sham-controlled study in 30 participants with\nGAD. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to the active or sham treatment and self-administer treatment at home\nfor the duration of the study. In this single study, we will evaluate metrics of feasibility (Specific Aim 1) and\nacceptability (Specific Aim 2). After demonstrating feasibility in Phase I, we will conduct a long-term pivotal\nclinical trial in Phase II to evaluate the effect of the Empower therapy on GAD remission. This pivotal study will\nsupport FDA clearance, enabling commercialization after Phase II.Narrative\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic, recurring condition that affects 2.9% (~6.4 million) of American\nadults each year. First-line treatments for GAD (including medications and cognitive behavioral therapy) provide\nlong-term remission rates of only 20-50%, so there is a need for more effective therapies. This Phase I SBIR\nproject proposes the development of a non-invasive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device to provide\nan at-home treatment for GAD."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nExcessive alcohol consumption is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and approximately 15\nmillion Americans suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD). AUD also economically expensive, with $249 billion\nspent annually for costs related to healthcare, lost work productivity, and crime. Despite the high prevalence of\nAUD and its severe consequences, less than 20% of those with AUD receive any treatment, mainly due to key\ndrawbacks of current treatment options. Guidelines for AUD treatment include pharmacotherapy, behavioral\nintervention, or both. Meta-analyses consistently demonstrate that first-line AUD medications (naltrexone and\nacamprosate) are only moderately effective, at best. AUD pharmacotherapies also have common side effects\nthat limit acceptability to patients. Similar to medications, behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavioral\ntherapy (CBT), provide only small\/moderate treatment benefits. In addition, programs often require abstinence,\nwhich can be a barrier as many AUD patients prefer non-abstinent goals. Recent preclinical and clinical research\nhas shown that acupuncture of a peripheral nerve pathway can significantly modulate craving-, reward-, and\nwithdrawal-related responses for drugs of abuse. We, thus, hypothesize that peripheral nerve stimulation can be\nan effective treatment for AUD through its direct effects on craving, reward, and withdrawal. Thus, TheraNova\nhas developed the Empower Neuromodulation System, a portable, easy-to-use transcutaneous electrical nerve\nstimulation (TENS) device for non-invasive nerve stimulation as a treatment for AUD. The Empower\nNeuromodulation System consists of a small, wearable Controller and gel electrodes that are temporarily\nadhered to the skin to stimulate the underlying nerve. Our Phase I clinical study with AUD patients demonstrated\nthat the Empower treatment significantly reduced alcohol consumption (mean reduction = 29%, p=0.026), alcohol\ncraving intensity (mean reduction 21%, p=0.001), and anxiety (mean reduction = 31%, plt0.001) (vs. baseline\nweek measurements) after only two weeks of treatment. While promising, this was a two-week, open-label study,\nso a longer, sham-controlled pivotal trial is needed to rigorously verify that Empower offers a comprehensive\nAUD treatment. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will first update the design of the Empower Neuromodulation System\nand conduct all bench testing required to support an FDA submission. Then, in Aim 2, we will conduct a multi-\nsite, sham-controlled pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of Empower as\na treatment for AUD. The data obtained through this work will support FDA clearance, enabling\ncommercialization of the Empower Neuromodulation System as a comprehensive treatment for AUD."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIn the United States, approximately 30% of reproductive aged women suffer from AUB and the associated\nsymptom of heavy uterine bleeding (menorrhagia), a menstrual disorder that drastically impairs quality of life and\nhas an annual economic burden of $37 billion. Women afflicted by AUB experience limitations in social, physical,\nand leisure activities, and incur a substantial personal financial burden due to work absence and home\nmanagement costs (rt$2,000 per year). Despite the high prevalence of this medical condition, clinicians rely on\nwomen who are distressed by their menses to give a subjective self-assessment of their menstrual blood loss\n(MBL), which has proven to be unreliable for accurate diagnosis and can lead to unnecessary surgery. Given\nthat these symptoms account for one-third of all office visits to the gynecologist, choosing an appropriate\ntreatment course is critical for providing high-quality care to Americans. Current methods for quantifying MBL\nhave key drawbacks that limit their use. Alkaline hematin (AH) testing is the standard required by regulatory\nbodies for objective quantification of MBL. Unfortunately, AH testing is impractical for routine clinical practice as\nit is expensive (~$1000 per cycle) and has poor acceptability, requiring patients to collect all used sanitary\nproducts and mail them to a lab facility for analysis. While pictorial blood loss assessment charts (PBLACs) offer\na less costly, semi-quantitative method for MBL quantification, they demonstrate a high rate of false positive\nresults (~59%), which leads to the over-diagnosis of menorrhagia. To address the need for a cost-effective, easy-\nto-use, and objective method to quantify MBL in premenopausal women, TheraNova has developed a cell phone-\nbased diagnostic tool, the electronic MBL Diary (eMBLD). Previously, in a proof of concept clinical study, we\ndemonstrated a strong correlation between eMBLD and AH testing, the gold-standard method for objective\nquantification of MBL. The goals of this Phase II proposal are to determine the effectiveness of our device for\naccurately diagnosing menorrhagia. First, we will verify the sensitivity of the image processing algorithm to\naccurately quantify MBL in women with both normal and heavy menses (Specific Aim 1). Second, we will conduct\na pivotal clinical study to validate the effectiveness of eMBLD for diagnosing menorrhagia (Specific Aim 2). The\ndata obtained will support FDA 510(k) clearance and will allow us to commercialize the system within four years\nof the funding of this proposal."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWith up to 4.8 million procedures annually in the U.S., laparoscopy has rapidly become the surgical standard for\na wide range of procedures. Compared to open procedures, laparoscopic approaches reduce muscle damage,\nblood loss, post-operative pain, complication rates, and length of hospital stay. However, laparoscopy has unique\ntechnique-specific limitations and complications, so the perception that minimally invasive surgery is minimally\ntraumatic is imprecise. There is now evidence that the frail, aging population may benefit most from laparoscopic\ntechniques. Thus, advances in laparoscopic techniques that reduce surgery-related complications would provide\nimportant benefits to the older patient population. Although laparoscopy has generally improved surgical\noutcomes, current instruments can contribute to procedure-related complications. To grasp and manipulate\ntissue, surgeons typically use the compressive grasper, a tool that pinches tissue between the teeth of two jaws.\nWhile compressive graspers are well-suited for grasping smaller structures, the typical V-shaped jaws only open\nto a maximum of 3.5-10 mm apart, so they are not optimized for grasping larger structures, particularly stiff\nstructures like the inflamed gallbladder. As a result of the compressive grasper\u2019s design, excessive grasping and\nretraction forces, long duration of grasps, and slippage of the tissue in the grasper jaws can all contribute to\ntissue injury and perforation. In turn, intraoperative tissue damage can lengthen operative time, result in\nconversion to traditional open surgery, and increase patient morbidity. In addition to immediately apparent\ndamage, tissue injury during surgery can result in delayed perforations and significant patient morbidity.\nTherefore, the risk of iatrogenic tissue injury is a central and ubiquitous concern for surgeons. To address the\nneed for a laparoscopic grasper capable of gripping a broad array of tissue types without the risk of slippage or\niatrogenic injury, TheraNova is developing the Lamprey Grasper, a novel, atraumatic laparoscopic grasper. Our\ngoal is to improve key functionalities within the grasper family, particularly in grasping larger, stiffer structures.\nIn preliminary studies, we demonstrated that several Lamprey Grasper designs enable a strong, reliable tissue\ngrasp while inducing less injury than a compressive grasper. The overall goals of this proposal are to build on\nthis promising work to optimize and validate the Lamprey Grasper. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a benchtop\nevaluation to identify the optimal Lamprey Grasper design for robust grasping across a range of porcine\nabdominal tissues. In Specific Aim 1, we will use the optimal design from Aim 1 to conduct a comprehensive in\nvivo evaluation of the Lamprey Grasper vs. a conventional compressive grasper. Two experienced laparoscopic\nsurgeons will perform a series of laparoscopic actions in Yorkshire pigs (n=6) to compare functionality, usability,\nand grasper-induced tissue injury between the two graspers. If this Phase I work is successful, in Phase II we\nwill conduct a large, post-operative survival animal study to validate the functionality, usability, and safety of the\nLamprey Grasper, which will support a 510(k) submission to the FDA.Narrative\nLaparoscopy has generally improved surgical outcomes for appropriately selected patients, but current\nlaparoscopic tissue graspers can contribute to procedure-related complications through grasping-inducing tissue\ninjury or perforation. There is now evidence that the frail, aging population may benefit most from laparoscopic\nprocedures, so advances in laparoscopic surgery that reduce complications would provide important benefits to\nthe older patient population. In this SBIR Phase I, we propose to optimize a novel laparoscopic instrument\ncapable of grasping a broad array of tissue types without the risk of slippage or traumatic injury."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAnnually, more than one million pediatric patients require enteral nutrition (EN) in the U.S. For patients in the\nneonatal intensive care unit (NICU), providing nutrition is especially critical to ensuring that proper growth and\ndevelopment occur. While EN is life-saving, feeding tubes (FTs) have seen limited innovation in recent years,\neven though they can be a source of complications. Today, FTs are placed blindly at the bedside in the NICU.\nFT misplacement into the duodenum, esophagus, and lungs is associated with complications that can lead to\nprolonged hospital stays, morbidity, and, in rare cases, mortality. Each NICU relies on a combination of methods\nfor placement confirmation, which include FT insertion length, auscultation, capnography, and aspiration of\ngastric residuals. Each method has limitations, resulting in high misplacement rate overall (4-59% reported in\nthe literature). Thus, there is an urgent need in the NICU for a smart FT that can provide safe navigation and\nevidence-based confirmation of gastric placement. EN management is also a central and ubiquitous priority for\nneonatologists. Many hospitals have adopted standardized feeding protocols, but personalizing nutrition\nmanagement to each infant\u2019s specific needs may improve development and overall outcomes. While\nappropriately advancing feeds is a priority, there is a delicate balance to achieve this while avoiding feeding\nintolerance (FI) and its complications. Accordingly, real-time, specific feedback regarding changes in infant\ndigestive status may enable maximized nutrient delivery with early detection of FI. To meet the need for a next-\ngeneration FT, TheraNova has developed the Gravitas System, a smart FT that provides: (1) an evidence-based\napproach to guide and verify gastric placement and (2) a unique gastric status metric to guide nutrition\nmanagement based on automated tracking of stomach contents. The Gravitas System consists of (1) an FT with\nembedded sensors and (2) a monitor which consists of an electronic controller and user-interface display. In our\nPhase I work, we confirmed the ability to accurately classify the anatomic location of the FT in a pre-clinical\nmodel and to measure the concentration of stomach contents in a bench-top model. The overall goal of this\nPhase II proposal is to validate the Gravitas System in NICU patients. First, we will conduct an observational\nstudy in the NICU to collect data for optimization of our FT placement algorithm (Aim 1). Second, using the\noptimized algorithm, we will conduct a pivotal study in the NICU to validate the accuracy of Gravitas FT\nplacement vs. standard, blind placement (Aim 2). Third, in both of these studies, after FT insertion and throughout\nEN management, we will continuously record stomach contents to develop our gastric status algorithm for\nproviding real-time data to clinicians regarding the patient\u2019s digestive status (Aim 3). Successful completion of\nthis proposed effort will support 510(k) clearance of the Gravitas System for guiding and confirming accurate FT\nplacement in neonates. Data on gastric status tracking (Aim 3) will also enable a follow-on clinical study to\nvalidate this novel feature."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOveractive bladder is a chronic and devastating condition in the aging population. Approximately 33 million\npeople in the United States suffer from overactive bladder (OAB) and associated urinary urge incontinence (UUI),\na chronic medical condition that drastically impairs quality of life and results in an annual economic burden of\n$66 billion. The psychological aspects of this chronic voiding dysfunction are particularly devastating; patients\nhave increased incidences of depression, social isolation and sleep deprivation. Given that the incidence of OAB\nincreases with advancing age, the prevalence of the condition and the total economic burden will continue to\nrise as the baby boomer population ages. Despite the high social and economic burden, a convenient, safe and\neffective treatment has yet to be realized. Recently, a minimally invasive neuromodulation device that provides\npercutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) of the afferent sacral nerve, Congentix\u2019s Urgent\u00ae PC, has shown\nclinical success; however, this device requires weekly in-clinic treatments as well as repeated placement of an\nelectrode into the posterior tibial nerve, both of which are cost prohibitive and challenging for patient adherence.\nImplantable neurostimulators (RENOVA iStim and eCoin\u2122) are also under development, but these devices\nrequire a surgical procedure and, accordingly, initial clinical studies have had high complication rates, with a\nsecond surgery often required to address these adverse events. To meet the need for a safe, effective,\ncomfortable, and easy-to-use treatment for OAB, TheraNova has developed an inexpensive, convenient device\nthat enables non-invasive tibial nerve stimulation at home. Previously, we demonstrated that subjects treated\nwith this system achieved reductions in the mean number of voids, the mean number of voids with moderate to\nsevere urgency, and the mean number of UUI events. The goals of the parent Phase II award are to determine\nthe effectiveness of our system versus a sham control treatment in a home-use, pivotal clinical study. In the\nparent award, we are conducting a clinical study to identify a well-blinded sham control treatment (Specific Aim\n1). We will also validate the treatment effectiveness and durability for mitigating urinary urge incontinence\ncompared to the sham control in a pivotal trial (Specific Aim 2). In the Diversity Supplement, we have assigned\nTheraNova\u2019s Software Engineer, Ms. Maitreyee Mittal, an engineering leadership role in the project. She will\nlead the software development efforts for the TranStim device in the pivotal clinical trial, which will be focused\non mobile app development. The app will be used by participants to log urinary voiding data, the primary data\ncollection means in the study and a critical component of the study\u2019s success. Ms. Mittal will also oversee all\ndevice manufacturing efforts and assist with device troubleshooting. The proposed work for Ms. Mittal will be\nperformed within the overall scope of the parent award.Narrative\nOveractive bladder is a chronic medical condition that significantly diminishes the quality of life for many elderly\npatients. Commercially available neurostimulation therapies for overactive bladder are efficacious, however, they\nare limited in clinical use due to their invasive and cumbersome nature. We propose a novel, non-invasive,\nperipheral nerve stimulation device for in-home treatment of overactive bladder."

This project aims to develop and test a non-invasive device to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women by delivering vibrationalstimulus to skeletal sites that are at high risk for fractures, particularly the hip and spine. Existing vibration devices require patients to stand on a platform for extended periods of time, which can lead to noncompliance, especially in the home setting. Moreover, when delivered through the feet, vibrations are attenuated significantly by the time they reach the hip and spine.  The proposed device offers to more directly stimulate these skeletal sites of interest using accelerometer- based feedback"

        "Abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sepsis occurs frequently among critically ill patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs). A key goal in treating patients suffering from septic shock is to normalize cardiac function while maintaining optimalfluid balance and tissue oxygenation levels. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and management is often critical to survival, but can also lead to fluid overload and potentially fatal downstream consequences. Currently there is a lack of adequate tools with which to monitor patient responses to fluid infusion, particularly those that can safely and accurately measure cardiac output or detect the onset of fluid overload. In response to this need we have developed the OmniSense catheter. Its innovative design combines fast pressure sensing functionality within the structure of a standard urinary drainage catheter. The sensitivity and bandwidth of our pressure measurement enables the monitoring of changes in cardiac output (from the relative amplitude of cardiovascular pressure waves transmitting into the bladder) and intra-abdominal pressure, both of which can be critical pieces of information for clinicians making treatment decisions during sepsis management. Use of the OmniSense catheter has clear advantages over other more invasive methods to measure cardiac output and detect fluid overload. Currently available tools to measure cardiac output (i.e. the Swan- Ganz catheter or Long Time Interval analysis based on arterial catheter measurements) have been shown toincur unacceptable infection risk for the patient and significantly increase the burden on nursing staff to administer and maintain. Moreover, methods to detect fluid overload often rely on observations during physical exam which are intermittent, subjective, and non-quantitative. The OmniSense device has the potential to directly track changes in cardiac output and detect fluid overload continuously, automatically, and quantitatively without any additional invasiveness or further burden on nursing staff. Our preliminary data support the feasibility of measuring relative cardiac output using the OmniSense and we have previously demonstrated the capacity of the device to provide clinically relevant readings of changes in intra-abdominal pressure. Here we propose to use a porcine model to test the capacity of the OmniSense to deliver accurate readings of changes in cardiac output in response to pharmacological manipulations of cardiac function. In addition we will experimentally induce fluid overload and test the ability of the OmniSense to detect the development of this condition early based on measurements of intra-abdominal pressure. This work is a crucial first step to lay the groundwork for future clinical studies with he ultimate goal of improving outcomesfor critically ill patients suffering from septic shock and other forms of hemodynamic insult.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sepsis occurs in approximately one-third of patients in the Intensive Care Unit, where it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Among patients suffering from septic shock or other forms of hemodynamic insult, fluid resuscitation treatment is critical to normalizing cardiac output and thus survival, but clinicians are lacking good tools for  assessing the effects of their ongoing management. The OmniSense device is designed to aid clinicians in hemodynamic optimization by providing accurate real-time measurements of changes in cardiac output and intra-abdominal pressure, without introducing any additional risk to the patient."

        "Abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) will experience dramatic improvements in their quality of life and life expectancy when the goal of engineering an artificial pancreas is finally realized. A critical component of such a system is to be able to measure changes in blood glucose rapidly, accurately, and continuously. Implantable continuous glucose monitors are an improvement over the fingerstick measurements that have been the norm for decades, but their performance is hampered by fundamental limitations of the interstitial (subcutaneous) space where they are currently implanted:  1) there is substantial lag time between changes in blood glucose and changes in interstitial glucose, 2) there is substantial variability in the lag time because perfusion of the interstitial space is variable, 3) there are steady-state inaccuracies due normal fluctuations in interstitial oxygen tension, and  4) due to tissue encapsulation, interstitial sensors need to be replaced frequently.  These limitations prevent interstitial sensors from being used to achieve tight glycemic control around routine activities that involve rapid changes in blood glucose, such as eating and exercise. Achieving tight glycemic control is the long-termgoal of our research program, as it is critical to preventing the devastating long-term sequelae in patients with T1DM.  The objective of this application is to determine the extent to which using the peritoneal space for glucose sensing (instead of the interstitial space) will move us toward this goal. Our central hypothesis is that the fluid in the peritoneal space tracks blood glucose changes with less lag time and less lag-time variability than the interstitial space, because the blood flow to this central, protected space is copious and robust to changes in temperature and cardiac output, and because the glucose kinetics of the peritoneal space are known to be fast. We additionally hypothesize that peritoneal sensors will exhibit less intersensor variability and oxygen- tension-related inaccuracies than the same sensors placed interstitially. Our hypothesis is supported by the physiology literature and by our pilot studies using a glycemic challenge, which show a faster glucose response for the peritoneal space vs. interstitial sensors.  We will test these hypotheses by comparing continuous glucose readings from sensors implanted in the peritoneal vs. interstitial spaces while exposing experimental animals (pigs) to intravenous glucose tolerance tests. These tests will be done under baseline conditions, then again during changes in body temperature and blood pressure, to test robustness. We will measure lag times and lag-time variability in all cases.  Additionally, we will test our proprietary technologyfor preventing tissue encapsulation, which is one of the principle challenges facing efforts to implant sensors chronically.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor control of blood glucose results in devastating long-term organ damage in patients with Type1 diabetes mellitus. Efforts to improve glucose control by engineering an artificial pancreas are hampered by the location in which state-of-the-art continuous glucose sensors are implanted: the interstitial space, which has slow glucose kinetics that arelabile to normal physiologic variations. The present proposal seeks to address these limitations by relocating the sensor to the intraperitoneal space in order to take advantage of peritoneal properties which are better suited to the performance demands ofglucose monitoring: fast glucose dynamics, robustness to changes in blood pressure and temperature, foreign body tolerance, and ability to enhance durability by preventing tissue encapsulation."
